benchmarks for linear algebra operations in python, notably comparing numpy with pytorch

`main.py` originally made to test some questions about pytorch vs LAPACK+BLAS linear algebra asked by [@dnychka](https://github.com/dnychka)

`check_pytorch.py` originally made for myself after I broke every single python installation on my machine and had to reinstall anything
